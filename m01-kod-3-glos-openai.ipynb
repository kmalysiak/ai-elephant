Let's break it down:\n\n- `!` at the beginning is typically used in Jupyter notebooks to run shell commands. In a regular Python environment or command line, you would omit this.\n\n- `pip` is the package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.\n\n- `install` is the pip command to install a package.\n\n- `--upgrade` is an option that tells pip to upgrade the package to the latest version if it's already installed. If the package isn't installed, it will simply install the latest version.\n\n- `openai` is the name of the package being installed or upgraded. This is the official Python client library for the OpenAI API, which allows developers to interact with various OpenAI services like GPT-3, DALL-E, and others.\n\nBy running this command, you're ensuring that you have the latest version of the OpenAI Python library installed in your Python environment. This is often important to access the most recent features and bug fixes in the OpenAI API client.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from openai import OpenAI\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nimport time \nimport IPython","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-28T08:42:09.065487Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-28T08:42:09.065881Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-28T08:42:09.966286Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-28T08:42:09.065838Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-28T08:42:09.964999Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This code consists of three import statements.

Interact with OpenAI's API\n2. Access some secret information (probably an API key) stored in the Kaggle environment\n3.

Initialize the OpenAI client with this API key, allowing the code to make authenticated requests to OpenAI's services.\n\nThis approach is a security best practice because it avoids hardcoding the API key directly in the script. Instead, it retrieves the key from a secure storage mechanism provided by the platform (in this case, Kaggle).\n\nAfter executing this code, the `client` object can be used to interact with OpenAI's API services, such as making requests to language models or other AI services provided by OpenAI.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tekst = \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
